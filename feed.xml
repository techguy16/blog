                <p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> I wrote this before Enderman's channel was reinstated at around 11:30AM NZDT.</p>
<p>If you've been in the Wintuber community for a while, you've probably heard by now that Enderman's channel has been terminated by YouTube because they "received multiple third-party claims of copyright infringement", along with his other accounts linked to the same Google account.</p>
<p>Yes, I do mean that Enderman, with all their ~385K subscribers.</p>
<p>Currently, YouTube is terminating channels which are linked to an account called <strong>棺のスターレイル遊び</strong> with the channel ID <strong>UCJTCXGi0ctZ-b4aNjHurulg</strong>. The channels were linked through an AdSense account as Russian YouTubers were using it to get around sanctions, and due to Google's totalitarian scheme where "if one channel gets terminated, they all do". What they were doing was a violation of the ToS, but Google could've just demonetized them all.</p>
<p>I think YouTube has gone too far with their AI force-feeding, even allowing it to terminate channels, like in this case. Imagine having Gemini, which is the worst and most innacurate AI chatbot ever, decide. Yes, there have been clear violations of the Terms of Service, but is terminating all the channels required? No. The best solution would've been closing the AdSense account which links the channels, but instead Google decided to terminate them all.</p>

                <p class="msg msg--warning">These flags have been marked for <strong>deprecation</strong> since Chrome 137 and could be removed <strong>at any time</strong>. This guide may not work at some point in the near future.</p>
<p>In Chrome 139 and above, Manifest V2 extensions are "no longer" supported. This is not the case, as the browser still internally supports these extensions. Through some digging in the Chromium source, we (<a href="https://youtube.com/@LagLife">LagLife</a> and myself) discovered that there is actually a command-line flag to re-enable these extensions. </p>
<h3>To re-enable Manifest V2 extensions:</h3>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Self-promo: </strong>Linux users are able to skip this guide and use <a href="https://github.com/techguy16/LinuxPatcher">LinuxPatcher</a> to automatically modify Chrome's shortcuts to launch with the required flag.</p>
<p>When launching Chrome, you will have to append a command-line flag to Chrome's executable. There are two flags that work, which are for different scenarios.</p>
<h5>Option #1</h5>
<pre class="language-bash"><code>--disable-features="ExtensionManifestV2Disabled, ExtensionManifestV2Unsupported, ExtensionManifestV2DeprecationWarning"</code></pre>
<p>This flag re-enables Manifest V2 extensions, hides the deprecation warning in <a href="chrome://extensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chrome://extensions</a> and also allows users to install Manifest V2 extensions from the Chrome Web Store. </p>
<h5>Option #2</h5>
<pre class="language-bash"><code>--enable-features="AllowLegacyMV2Extensions"</code></pre>
<p>This flag re-enables Manifest V2 extensions that were previously installed. This does not allow installing extensions from the Chrome Web Store.</p>
<h3>How was this discovered?</h3>
<p>This was discovered in the <em><a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/test/chromedriver/test/run_py_tests.py;l=385?q=manifestv2disabled&amp;ss=chromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">run_py_tests.py</a></em> file in the Chromium source, which has a test that disables Google's absurd decision as many tests still rely on Manifest V2.</p>
<p>The <em><a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:extensions/common/extension_features.cc;l=96?q=ExtensionManifestV2Disabled&amp;ss=chromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extension_features.cc</a></em> file has various "features" relating to disabling Manifest V2, which is where <em>ExtensionManifestV2DeprecationWarning</em> were discovered.</p>
