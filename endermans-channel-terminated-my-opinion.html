The channels were linked through an AdSense account as Russian YouTubers were using it to get around sanctions, and due to Google's totalitarian scheme where "if one channel gets terminated, they all do". What they were doing was a violation of the ToS, but Google could've just demonetized them all.</p><p>I think YouTube has gone too far with their AI force-feeding, even allowing it to terminate channels, like in this case. Imagine having Gemini, which is the worst and most innacurate AI chatbot ever, decide. Yes, there have been clear violations of the Terms of Service, but is terminating all the channels required? No. The best solution would've been closing the AdSense account which links the channels, but instead Google decided to terminate them all.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on November 5, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://techguy16.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://techguy16.github.io/blog/authors/techguy16/" rel="author">techguy16</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://techguy16.github.io/blog/bring-back-manifest-v2-extensions-to-chrome.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Bring back Manifest V2 extensions to Chrome!</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>By techguy16, 2025</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://youtube.com/@techguy16" aria-label="Youtube"><svg><use xlink:href="https://techguy16.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://techguy16.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://techguy16.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
