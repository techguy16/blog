The channels were supposedly linked through an AdSense account as Russian YouTubers were using it to get around sanctions, and due to Google's totalitarian scheme where \"if one channel gets terminated, they all do\". If they were doing that, that is a violation of the ToS. If so, Google could've just demonetized them all.</p>\n<p>I think YouTube has gone too far with their AI force-feeding, even allowing it to terminate channels, like in this case. Imagine having Gemini, which is the worst and most innacurate AI chatbot ever, decide. Yes, there have been clear violations of the Terms of Service, but is terminating all the channels required? No. The best solution would've been closing the AdSense account which links the channels, but instead Google decided to terminate them all.</p>",

This guide may not work at some point in the near future.</p>\n<p>In Chrome 139 and above, Manifest V2 extensions are \"no longer\" supported. This is not the case, as the browser still internally supports these extensions. Through some digging in the Chromium source, we (<a href=\"https://youtube.com/@LagLife\">LagLife</a> and myself) discovered that there is actually a command-line flag to re-enable these extensions. </p>\n<h3>To re-enable Manifest V2 extensions:</h3>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\"><strong>Self-promo: </strong>Linux users are able to skip this guide and use <a href=\"https://github.com/techguy16/LinuxPatcher\">LinuxPatcher</a> to automatically modify Chrome's shortcuts to launch with the required flag.</p>\n<p>When launching Chrome, you will have to append a command-line flag to Chrome's executable. There are two flags that work, which are for different scenarios.</p>\n<h5>Option #1</h5>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>--disable-features=\"ExtensionManifestV2Disabled, ExtensionManifestV2Unsupported, ExtensionManifestV2DeprecationWarning\"</code></pre>\n<p>This flag re-enables Manifest V2 extensions, hides the deprecation warning in <a href=\"chrome://extensions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chrome://extensions</a> and also allows users to install Manifest V2 extensions from the Chrome Web Store. </p>\n<h5>Option #2</h5>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>--enable-features=\"AllowLegacyMV2Extensions\"</code></pre>\n<p>This flag re-enables Manifest V2 extensions that were previously installed. This does not allow installing extensions from the Chrome Web Store.</p>\n<h3>How was this discovered?</h3>\n<p>This was discovered in the <em><a href=\"https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/test/chromedriver/test/run_py_tests.py;l=385?q=manifestv2disabled&amp;ss=chromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">run_py_tests.py</a></em> file in the Chromium source, which has a test that disables Google's absurd decision as many tests still rely on Manifest V2.</p>\n<p>The <em><a href=\"https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:extensions/common/extension_features.cc;l=96?q=ExtensionManifestV2Disabled&amp;ss=chromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">extension_features.cc</a></em> file has various \"features\" relating to disabling Manifest V2, which is where <em>ExtensionManifestV2DeprecationWarning</em> were discovered.</p>\n<p> </p>",
